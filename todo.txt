# What to track

=== TIMEBASE ===
- current state TBASe:STATe?
- maybe duration
  - TBASe:STATe:HOLDover:DUration?
  - TBASe:STATe:LOCK:DURation?
  - TBASe:STATe:WARMup:DURation?
- maybe installed timebase
- frequency control voltage TBASe:FCONtrol
- maybe gps lock config TBASe:CONFig:LOCK
- loop bandwidth TBASe:CONFig:BWIDth
- loop time constant TBASe:TCONstant
- time interval TBASe:TINTerval
- criteria to enter holdover TBASe:CONFig:TINTerval:LIMit
- criteria to leave holdover TBASe:CONFig:HMODe

=== GPS ===
- GPS date SYSTem:DATe
- GPS time SYSTem:TIMe
- GPS position GPS:POSition
- maybe GPS survey state & progress but not really necessary
- GPS satellites tracked
  - GPS:SATellite:TRACking
  - GPS:SATellite:TRACking:STATus
- GPS reciever status
  - STATus:GPS:CONDition
  - STATus:GPS:EVENt -> maybe to logs
- timing alignment (UTC or otherwise)
  - GPS:CONFig:ALIGnment
  - GPS:UTC:OFFSet
- timing quality GPS:CONFig:QUALity
- maybe survey mode
  - GPS:CONFig:SURVey:Mode
  - GPS:CONFig:SURVey:FIXes
- antenna delay correction GPS:CONFig:ADELay

=== COMMUNICATION ===
- maybe system errors SYSTem:ERRor
- IP & MAC address if applicable
  - SYSTem:COMMunicate:LAN:MAC
  - SYSTem:COMMunicate:LAN:IPADress
  - SYSTem:COMMunicate:LAN:GATeway

=== SYSTEM ===
- device info
  - *IDN?
  - *OPT?


=== Logging ==
- timebase events
